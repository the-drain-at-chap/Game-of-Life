* Zybook and Class Notes
* Student who took the class before helped me figure out the logic with the Classic, Mirror, and Doughnut modes.      Everything else was figured out on my own.

# Errors and Other Notes

* No errors, program seems to run fine. However, not entirely sure if all my simulations will be correct.
* For map file I couldn't figure out how to open an input file with the file path, so I only prompted the user to give a txt file.
